# Quiz-App
Android application 1 from the book "The Big Nerd Ranch guide"

throughout building this first apps I have learned about:

- activity lifecycles
- handling listeners
- rotation issues that might come up
- layouts
- onSaveInstanceState(â€¦) one way to handle rotation issues
- starting up new activity and passing data (using  intents)
- putting and getting the extras
- how android sees my activities

The challanges are solved and there are also added not  necessery elements on my own.
